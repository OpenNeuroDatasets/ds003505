# VEPCON: Source imaging of high-density visual evoked potentials with multi-scale brain parcellations and connectomes

## Overview

The multimodal dataset VEPCON follows the BIDS standard and provides raw data of high-density EEG, structural MRI and diffusion weighted images (DWI) recorded in 20 participants and derivatives.

Visual evoked potentials were recorded while participants discriminated briefly presented faces from scrambled faces, or coherently moving stimuli from incoherent ones. MRI and DWI were recorded in a separate session from the same participants.

The dataset contains pre-processed EEG of single trials in each condition, behavioral measures, structural MRIs, individual brain parcellations at 5 spatial resolutions (66 to 998 regions), and corresponding structural connectomes based on fiber count, fiber density, average fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps. In addition, we provide EEG inverse solutions for source imaging based on individual anatomy, and Python and Matlab code for deriving time-series of activity in each brain region, at each parcellation level.

This dataset can contribute to multimodal methods development, studying structure-function relations, as well as unimodal optimization of source imaging and graph analysis, among many other possibilities.
