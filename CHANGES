  - Add bem/ folders in freesurfer-7.1.1 derivatives for all subjects,
    except sub-05 and sub-15, to serve the EEG pipeline tutorial of CMP3.
    The bem/ folder contains all files generated by MNE to describe the
    Boundary Element Model (BEM) based on Freesurfer's surfaces estimated
    from the original undefaced T1w scans.
  - Removal of old cmp-v3.0.0-beta-RC1 derivatives, for which connectome pickle files
    have been generated with Python 2.7.
1.1.0 2022-02-15
  - Update README and run_cmp3.sh in code/ConnectomeMapper-Docker to use connectomemapper v3.0.3.
